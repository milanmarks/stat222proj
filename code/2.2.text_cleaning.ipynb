       "'external factors that could adversely affect us the ongoing covid    pandemic has significantly impacted worldwide economic conditions and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business  the ongoing covid    pandemic has negatively impacted worldwide economic activity and continues to create challenges in our markets  the covid    pandemic and the related mitigation measures have disrupted our supply chain  resulting in longer lead times in materials available from suppliers and extended shipping time for these materials to reach our facilities  the occurrence or resurgence of global or regional health events such as the covid    pandemic  and the related government responses  could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity  as such  we will continue to closely monitor covid    and will continue to reassess our strategy and operational structure on a regular  ongoing basis  oil commodity price levels could affect demand for our oil and gas products  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity  demand for many of our products and the profitability of our operations depend primarily on the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activity  prevailing oil and gas prices  with an emphasis on crude oil prices  and market expectations regarding potential changes in such prices significantly affect the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activity  during periods of improved energy commodity prices  the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand  which results in increased demand for our customers services leading to increased demand in our products  conversely  in periods when these energy commodity prices deteriorate  capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to contract causing demand for our products to weaken  historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are subject to wide fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  these factors include the level of consumer demand  regional and international economic conditions  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  including those related to climate change   price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions  the war between russia and ukraine  instability and hostilities in the middle east and other significant oil producing regions  increases and decreases in the supply of oil and gas  the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries   opec   to set and maintain production levels and prices of foreign imports  crude oil prices held above     per barrel throughout      and through september       which may result in higher cash flows for exploration and production companies  any material changes in oil and gas prices or other market trends  like slowing growth of the global economy  could adversely impact seismic exploration activity and would likely affect the demand for the company s products and could materially and adversely affect its results of operations and liquidity  generally  imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and gas will affect oil and gas prices and  in such circumstances  demand for our oil and gas products may be adversely affected when world supplies exceed demand  the ongoing armed conflict between russia and ukraine could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations  including our ability to repatriate cash from russia  a portion of our oil and gas product manufacturing is conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary  geospace technologies eurasia llc   gte    which is based in the russian federation  in february       the russian federation launched a full scale military invasion of ukraine  and russia and ukraine continue to engage in active and armed conflict as of november       although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable  the conflict in ukraine could lead to market disruptions  including significant volatility in commodity prices  credit and capital markets  as well as supply chain interruptions in addition to any direct impact on our operations in russia  as a result of the invasion  the governments of several western nations  including the u s   canada  the united kingdom and the european union  implemented new and or expanded economic sanctions and export restrictions against russia  russian backed separatist regions in ukraine  certain banks  companies  government officials  and other individuals in russia and belarus  the implementation of these sanctions and export restrictions  in combination with the withdrawal of numerous private companies from the russian market  has had  and is likely to continue to have  a negative impact on the company s business in the region  during fiscal year       we imported      million of products from gte for resale elsewhere in the world  the rapid changes in rules and implementation of new rules on imports and exports of goods involving russia has also led to serious delays in getting goods to or from russia as port authorities struggle to keep up with the changing environment  if imports of these products from the russian federation are restricted by government regulation  we may be forced to find other sources for the manufacturing of these products at potentially higher costs  likewise  restrictions on our ability to send products to our subsidiary in russia may force our subsidiary to have to find other sources for the manufacturing of these products at potentially higher costs  however  our exports to gte have historically been limited  boycotts  protests  unfavorable regulations  additional governmental sanctions and other actions in the region could also adversely affect our ability to operate profitably  delays in obtaining governmental approvals can affect our ability to timely deliver our products pursuant to contractual obligations  which could result in us being liable to our customers for damages  the risk of doing business in the russian federation and other economically or politically volatile areas could adversely affect our operations and earnings  it is possible that increasing sanctions  export controls  restrictions on access to financial institutions  supply and transportation challenges  or other circumstances or considerations could necessitate a reduction  or even discontinuation  of operations by gte or other business in russia  we are actively monitoring the situation in ukraine and russia and assessing its impact on our business  including gte  the net carrying value of gte on our consolidated balance sheet at september          was      million  including cash of      million  in response to sanctions imposed by the u s  and others on russia  the russian government has imposed restrictions on companies  abilities to repatriate or otherwise remit cash from their russian based operations to locations outside of russia  as a result  this cash can be used in our russian operations  but we may be unable to transfer it out of russia without incurring substantial costs  if at all  in addition to the      million of products we imported from gte in fiscal year       the subsidiary generated      million in revenue from domestic sales in fiscal year       we have no way to predict the duration  progress or outcome of the military conflict in ukraine  the extent and duration of the military action  sanctions  and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of time  our foreign subsidiaries and foreign marketing efforts are subject to additional political  economic  legal and other uncertainties not generally associated with domestic operations  based on customer billing data  revenue to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately     of our revenue during fiscal year       however  we believe the percentage of revenue outside the united states is likely higher since many of our products are first delivered to a domestic location and ultimately shipped to a foreign location  we again expect revenue outside of the united states to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for fiscal year      and subsequent years  foreign revenue is subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the united states  including the risk of war  terrorist activities  civil disturbances  embargo and government activities  shifting foreign attitudes about conducting business activities with the united states  restrictions of the movement and exchange of funds  inhibitions of our ability to collect accounts receivable or repossess our rental equipment  international sanctions  expropriation and nationalization of our assets or those of our customers  currency fluctuations  devaluations and conversion restrictions  confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies and governmental actions that may result in the deprivation of our contractual rights  all of which may disrupt markets or our operations  foreign revenue is also generally subject to the risk of compliance with additional laws  including tariff regulations and import and export restrictions  international revenue transactions for our products containing hydrophones require prior u s  government approval in the form of an export license  which may be withheld by the u s  government based upon factors which we cannot predict  we may experience difficulties in connection with future foreign revenue  additionally  due to foreign laws and restrictions  should we experience substantial growth in certain foreign markets  for example in the russian federation  we may not be able to transfer cash balances to the united states to assist with debt servicing or other obligations  increases in tariffs  trade restrictions or taxes on our products could have an adverse impact on our operations  in fiscal year       customers outside the united states accounted for approximately     of our revenues  we also purchase a portion of our raw materials from suppliers in china and other foreign countries  the commerce we conduct in the international marketplace makes us subject to tariffs  trade restrictions and other taxes when the raw materials we purchase  and the products we ship  cross international borders  trade tensions between the united states and china  as well as those between the u s  and canada  mexico and other countries have been escalating in recent years  trade tensions have led to a series of tariffs imposed by the u s  on imports from china  as well as retaliatory tariffs imposed by china on imports from the u s  if the u s  and china are able to negotiate the issues to restore a mutually advantageous and fair trading regime  the increased tariffs could be eliminated  certain raw materials we purchase from china are subject to these tariffs which has increased our manufacturing costs  products we sell into certain foreign markets could also become subject to similar retaliatory tariffs  making the products we sell uncompetitive to similar products not subjected to such import tariffs  further changes in u s  trade policies  tariffs  taxes  export restrictions or other trade barriers  or restrictions on raw materials including rare earth minerals  may limit our ability to produce products  increase our manufacturing costs  decrease our profit margins  reduce the competitiveness of our products  or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase raw materials  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial conditions  climate change and legislation designed to reduce climate change the physical and regulatory effects of climate change could have a negative impact on our operations  our customers  operations and the overall demand for our customers  products and  accordingly  our services  there is an increasing focus of local  state  regional  national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas   ghg   emissions and climate change issues  legislation to regulate ghg emissions has periodically been introduced in the u s  congress  and there has been a wide ranging policy debate  both in the united states and internationally  regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation  these efforts have included consideration of cap and trade programs  carbon taxes  ghg reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit ghg emissions from certain sources  some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions  those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement  in the absence of federal ghg limiting legislation  the epa has determined that ghg emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that  among other things  establish construction and operating permit reviews for ghg emissions from certain large stationary sources  require the monitoring and annual reporting of ghg emissions from certain oil and natural gas system sources  implement clean air act emission standards directing the reduction of methane emissions from certain new  modified  or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector  and together with the dot  implement ghg emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the united states  in april       the united states signed the paris agreement  which requires countries to review and  represent a progression  in their nationally determined contributions  which set emissions reduction goals  every five years  under the paris agreement  the biden administration has committed the united states to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by        from      levels by       in november       the unites states and other countries entered into the glasgow climate pact  which includes a range of measures designed to address climate change  including  but not limited to the phase out of fossil fuel subsidies  reducing methane emissions     by       and cooperating toward the advancement of the development of clean energy  several states and geographic regions in the united states have also adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of ghgs  including cap and trade regimes and commitments to contribute to meeting the goals of the paris agreement  governmental  scientific  and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from ghg emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the united states  president biden and congress have identified climate change as a priority  and it is likely that additional executive orders  regulatory action  and or legislation targeting greenhouse gas emissions  or prohibiting or restricting oil and gas development activities in certain areas  will be proposed and or promulgated during the biden administration  president biden issued an executive order imposing a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices  president biden s order also establishes climate change as a primary foreign policy and national security consideration  affirms that achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by or before midcentury is a critical priority  affirms the biden administration s desire to establish the united states as a leader in addressing climate change  generally further integrates climate change and environmental justice considerations into government agencies  decision making  and eliminates fossil fuel subsidies  among other measures  other actions impacting oil and natural gas production activities that could be pursued by the biden administration may include more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of liquified natural gas export facilities  it is not possible at this time to predict the timing and effects of climate change or whether additional climate related legislation  regulations or other measures will be adopted at the local  state  regional  national and international levels  however  continued efforts by governments and non governmental organizations to reduce ghg emissions appear likely  and additional legislation  regulation or other measures that control or limit ghg emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our customers and our business  because our business depends on the level of oil exploration  existing or future laws or regulations related to ghgs and climate change  including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources  our business could be negatively impacted if such laws or regulations reduce demand for our customers  products and  accordingly  our services  these political  litigation  and financial risks may result in our customers restricting or cancelling exploration or production activities which also could reduce demand for our products and services  in addition to regulatory impacts  the occurrence of weather events caused or exacerbated by climate change could impact local  national or global commodity demand or availability in ways that could be material to our business and or the business of our customers  we operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may be able to provide newer or better products than we are able to provide the markets for most of our products are highly competitive  many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater marketing  financial and technical resources than we do  some competitors currently offer a broader range of instruments and equipment for sale than we do and may offer financing arrangements to customers on terms that we may not be able to match  in addition  new competitors may enter the market and competition could intensify  revenue from our products may not continue at current volumes or prices if current competitors or new market entrants introduce new products with better features  performance  price or other characteristics than our products  competitive pressures or other factors may also result in significant price competition that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  a general downturn in the economy in future periods may adversely affect our business  economic slowdowns  currently or in the future  in the united states  china or india  could adversely affect our business in ways that we cannot predict  during times of economic slowdown  our customers may reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects and product orders  such developments occur even among customers that are not experiencing financial difficulties  during times of economic slowdowns  some of our customers have  and other customers may have  undergone restructuring or bankruptcy that has or could adversely impact our revenues and profitability  any economic downturn may adversely affect the demand for oil and gas generally or cause volatility in oil and gas commodity prices and  therefore  adversely affect the demand for delivery of our oil and gas products  it could also adversely affect the demand for consumer and industrial products  which could in turn adversely affect our adjacent markets business segment  to the extent these factors adversely affect other companies in the industries we serve  there could be an oversupply of products and services and downward pressure on pricing for our products and services  which could adversely affect us  additionally  bankruptcies or financial difficulties among our oil and gas customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity and profitability  for a discussion of the customers of our oil and gas products  see  the limited market for our oil and gas products can affect our revenue   below  risks associated with our business strategy and operations our new products require a substantial investment by us in research and development expense and may not achieve market acceptance  our outlook and assumptions are based on various macro economic factors and internal assessments  and actual market conditions could vary materially from those assumed  in recent years  we have incurred significant expenditures to fund our research and development efforts  and we intend to continue those expenditures in the future  however  research and development is by its nature speculative  and we cannot assure that these expenditures will result in the development of new products or services or that any new products and services we have developed recently or may develop in the future will be commercially marketable or profitable to us  in particular  we have incurred substantial expenditures to develop our oil and gas nodal seismic data acquisition systems  as well as other products for prm applications  in addition  we try to use some of our capabilities to supply products to new adjacent and emerging markets  we cannot assure that we will realize our expectations regarding acceptance of and revenue generated by our new products and services in existing or new markets  the short term nature of our order backlog for sales of our oil and gas products and delayed or canceled customer orders may cause us to experience fluctuations in quarterly results of operations  historically  the rate of new orders for the sale of our oil and gas products has varied substantially from quarter to quarter  moreover  we typically operate  and expect to continue operating  on the basis of orders in hand for our products before we commence substantial manufacturing  runs   the short term nature of our order backlog for most of our oil and gas products generally does not allow us to predict with any accuracy demand for our products more than approximately three months in advance  thus  our ability to replenish orders and the completion of orders  particularly large orders for deep water prm projects  can significantly impact our operating results and cash flow for any quarter  and results of operations for any one quarter may not be indicative of results of operations for future quarters  additionally  customers can delay or even cancel orders and rental contracts before product delivery occurs  for larger orders which generally require us to make a substantial capital investment in our inventories or rental fleet  we attempt to negotiate for a non refundable deposit or cancellation penalties depending on our relationship with the customer  however  such deposits or penalties  even when obtained  may not fully compensate us for our inventory investment and forgone profits if the order is ultimately cancelled  these periodic fluctuations in our operating results and the impact of any order delays cancellations could adversely affect our stock price  our credit risk could increase and we may incur bad debt write offs if our customers continue to face difficult economic circumstances  while we believe that our allowance for bad debts is adequate in light of known circumstances  additional amounts attributable to uncollectible accounts and notes receivable and bad debt write offs may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  many of our oil and gas customers are not well capitalized and as a result cannot always pay our invoices when due  we have in the past incurred write offs in our accounts and notes receivable due to customer credit problems  we have found it necessary from time to time to extend trade credit  including promissory notes  to long term customers and others where some risks of non payment exist  many of our oil and gas customers continue to experience significant liquidity difficulties  which increase those credit risks  due to prolonged periods of low crude oil prices  an increase in the level of bad debts and any deterioration in our credit risk could adversely affect the price of our stock  in addition  we rent equipment to our oil and gas customers who utilize such equipment in various countries around the world  if these customers experience financial difficulties  it could be difficult or impossible to retrieve our rental equipment from foreign countries  the industries in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological development and product obsolescence  which may affect our ability to provide product enhancements or new products on a timely and cost effective basis  our instruments and equipment are constantly undergoing rapid technological improvement  our future success depends on our ability to continue to    improve our existing product lines    address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers    maintain a reputation for technological leadership    maintain market acceptance of our products    anticipate changes in technology and industry standards    respond to technological developments on a timely basis and   develop new markets for our products and capabilities  current competitors or new market entrants may develop new technologies  products or standards that could render our products obsolete  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  product enhancements or new products that respond to technological developments  that are accepted in the marketplace or that comply with new industry standards  additionally  in anticipation of customer product orders  from time to time we acquire substantial quantities of inventories  which if not sold or integrated into products within a reasonable period of time  could become obsolete  in such case  we would be required to impair the value of such inventories on our balance sheet  the limited market for our oil and gas markets and emerging markets  products can affect our revenue  in our oil and gas markets segment  we generally market many of our products to seismic service contractors  we estimate that fewer than    oil and gas seismic contracting companies are currently operating in countries other than those operating in the russian federation and the former soviet union  india  the people s republic of china and certain eastern european countries  where such information is difficult to verify  we estimate that fewer than    seismic contractors are engaged in marine seismic exploration activities  due to these market factors  a relatively small number of customers  some of whom are experiencing financial difficulties  account for most of our oil and gas product revenue  from time to time  these contractors have sought to vertically integrate and acquire our competitors  which has influenced their supplier decisions before and after such transactions  in addition  consolidation among our customers may further concentrate our business to a limited number of customers and expose us to increased risks related to dependence on a small number of customers  we market our seabed prm systems  products to large oil and gas companies  since this product s introduction in       we have received system orders from three offshore oil and gas operators  bp  shell and equinor  which have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in fiscal year      and prior fiscal years  we have not received any orders for large scale seabed prm systems since november       our emerging markets segment primarily sells its products to a small number of agencies within the u s  government  the loss of a small number of these customers  and particularly our oil and gas customers  could materially and adversely impact our future revenues  we cannot be certain of the effectiveness of patent protection on our products  we hold and from time to time apply for certain patents relating to some of our products  we cannot assure you that our patents will prove enforceable or free of challenge  that any patents will be issued for which we have applied or that competitors will not develop functionally similar technology outside the protection of any patents we have or may obtain  our strategy of renting our oil and gas seismic products exposes us to additional risks relating to equipment recovery  rental renewals  technological obsolescence and impairment of assets  our rental fleet of oil and gas seismic equipment represents a significant portion of our assets and accounts for a significant portion of our revenue  equipment we rent to our customers is frequently located in foreign countries where retrieval of the equipment after the termination of the rental agreement is difficult or impossible if the customer does not return the equipment  the costs associated with retrieving this equipment or the loss of equipment that is not retrieved could be significant and could adversely affect our operations and earnings  the advancement of seismic technology having a significant competitive advantage over the equipment in our rental fleet could have an adverse effect on our ability to profitably rent and or sell this equipment  significant improvements in technology may also require us to record asset impairment charges to write down the value of our rental fleet investment and to invest significant sums to upgrade or replace our rental fleet with newer equipment demanded by our customers  in addition  rental contracts may not be renewed for equipment in our rental fleet  significant technology improvements by our competitors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and earnings  our equipment rental business has high fixed costs  which primarily consist of depreciation expenses  in periods of declining rental revenue  these fixed costs generally do not decline  as a result  any significant decline in rental revenue caused by reduced demand could adversely affect our results of operations  our expansion into the border and perimeter security market may not be successful  we have not previously operated in the border and perimeter security marketplace prior to our      acquisition of quantum  quantum is also a relatively recent entrant into this marketplace  and quantum was not cash flow positive when we acquired it  in fiscal year       we completed our first contract with the u s  customs and border protection   cbp    except for on going service and maintenance  while we will continue to devote management time and resources  financial and otherwise  to develop our business in this marketplace  our lack of experience in this market makes it difficult to estimate our financial returns from this business  in addition  some of the customers for this business will be governmental entities and contracting with those entities can be difficult  costly  and unpredictable  we do not have extensive experience in government contracting  and so we may not win  retain  or perform under such future contracts in a manner that is profitable  if we are not successful in this emerging market segment  it will negatively impact our financial performance and could negatively impact our reputation and harm our other business segments  cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions of our information technology network and systems could adversely affect our business  we rely on information technology networks and systems  some of which are owned and operated by third parties  to process  transmit and store electronic information  in particular  we depend on our information technology infrastructure for a variety of functions  including worldwide financial reporting  inventory management  procurement  invoicing and email communications  any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  terrorist attacks and similar events  despite the implementation of network security measures  our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may also be vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  malware and similar disruptions  malware  if surreptitiously installed on our systems and not timely detected and removed  could collect and disclose sensitive information relating to our customers  employees or others  exposing us to legal liability and causing us to suffer reputational damage  it could also lead to disruptions in critical systems or the corruption or destruction of critical data  if we are unable to prevent such outages and breaches  these events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions  loss of business or potential liability  we rely on key suppliers for certain components used in our products  certain models of our oil and gas marine wireless products require a timing device we purchase from a united states manufacturer  we currently do not possess the ability to manufacture this component and have no other reliable source for this device  if this manufacturer were to discontinue its production of this timing device  were to become unwilling to contract with us on competitive terms or were unable to supply the component in sufficient quantities to meet our requirements  our ability to compete in the marine wireless marketplace could be impaired  which could adversely affect our financial performance  for our imaging products  we purchase all of our thermal film from one manufacturer  except for the film sold to us by this manufacturer  we know of no other source for thermal film that performs as well in our imaging equipment  if the manufacturer were to discontinue producing thermal film  were to become unwilling to contract with us on competitive terms or were unable to supply thermal film in sufficient quantities to meet our requirements  our ability to compete in the direct thermal imaging marketplace could be impaired  which could adversely affect our financial performance  our success depends upon a limited number of key personnel  our success depends on attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals  a number of our employees are highly skilled engineers and other professionals  in addition  our success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of the members of our senior management team  if we fail to continue to attract and retain such professionals  our ability to compete in the industry could be adversely affected  we have a minimal disaster recovery program at our houston facilities  due to its proximity to the texas gulf coast  our facilities in houston  texas are annually subject to the threat of hurricanes  and the aftermath that follows  hurricanes may cause  among other types of damage  the loss of electrical power for extended periods of time  if we lost electrical power at our pinemont facility  or if a fire or other natural disaster occurred  we would be unable to continue our manufacturing operations during the power outage because we do not own a generator or any other back up power source large enough to provide for our manufacturing power consumption needs  additionally  we do not have an alternative manufacturing or operating location in the united states  therefore  a significant disruption in our manufacturing operations could materially and adversely affect our business operations during an extended period of a power outage  fire or other natural disaster  we have a back up generator to provide power for our information technology operations  we store our back up data offsite and we replicate our mission critical data to an alternative cloud based data center on a real time basis  in the event of a major service interruption in our data center  we believe we would be able to activate our mission critical applications within less than    hours  our credit agreement imposes restrictions on our business  we and several of our subsidiaries domiciled in the united states are parties to a credit agreement  amounts available for borrowing under the credit agreement are determined by a borrowing base  which is determined based upon certain of our domestic assets  borrowings under the credit agreement will be secured by substantially all of our domestic assets  except for certain excluded property  the credit agreement limits the incurrence of additional indebtedness  contains a covenant that requires us to maintain a certain amount of consolidated tangible net worth and liquidity  and contains other covenants customary in agreements of this type  our ability to comply with these restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control  including  but not limited to  prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions and continuing declines in our product revenue  the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions  as well as any failure to make a payment of interest or principal when due  could result in a default under the credit agreement  such a default would permit our lender to declare any amounts borrowed from it to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest  and our ability to borrow under the credit agreement could be terminated  if we are unable to repay any debts owed to our lender  the lender could proceed against the collateral securing such debt  while we intend to seek alternative sources of cash in such a situation  there is no guarantee that any alternative cash source would be available or would be available on terms favorable to us  reliance on third party subcontractors could adversely affect our results of operations and reputation  we may rely on subcontractors to complete certain projects  the quality and timing of production and services by our subcontractors is not totally under our control  reliance on subcontractors gives us less control over a project and exposes us to significant risks  including late delivery  substandard quality and high costs  the failure of our subcontractors to deliver quality products or services in a timely manner could adversely affect our profitability and reputation  the high fixed costs of our operations could adversely affect our results of operations  we have a high fixed cost structure primarily consisting of  i  depreciation expenses associated with our rental equipment and  ii  fixed manufacturing costs including salaries and benefits  taxes  insurance  maintenance  depreciation and other fixed manufacturing costs  in regards to our rental equipment  large declines in the demand for rental equipment could result in substantial operating losses due to the on going fixed nature of rental equipment depreciation expense  concerning our product manufacturing costs  in periods of low product demand our fixed costs generally do not decline or may decline only in modest increments  therefore  lower demand for our rental equipment and manufactured products could adversely affect our results of operations  legal and compliance risks our global operations expose us to risks associated with conducting business internationally  including failure to comply with u s  laws which apply to international operations  such as the foreign corrupt practices act and u s  export control laws  as well as the laws of other countries we have offices in brazil  colombia  canada  the russian federation  kazakhstan and the united kingdom  in addition to our offices in the united states  in addition to the risks that are inherent in conducting business internationally  we are also liable for compliance with international and u s  laws and regulations that apply to our international operations  these laws and regulations include data privacy requirements  labor relations laws  tax laws  anti competition regulations  import and trade restrictions  export control laws  u s  laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws in other countries which also prohibit certain payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers  many of our products are subject to u s  export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold  or require an export license in connection with revenue transactions outside the united states  given the high level of complexity of these laws  there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached  for example through the negligent or the unauthorized intentional behavior of individual employees  our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise  additionally  we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners  violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines  criminal sanctions against us  our officers or our employees  and prohibitions on the conduct of our business  any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation  our brands  our international expansion efforts  our ability to attract and retain employees  our business and our operating results  because we have no plans to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future  investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us  we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our incorporation and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future  any payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent on the amount of funds legally available  our financial condition  capital requirements  loan covenants and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant  accordingly  investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation  which may never occur  as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment  we have a relatively small public float  and our stock price may be volatile  at september           we have approximately      million shares outstanding held by non affiliates  this limited number of shares outstanding results in a relatively limited market for our common stock  our daily trading volume for the year ended september          averaged approximately        shares  our small float and daily trading volumes have in the past caused  and may in the future result in  significant volatility in our stock price  financial and accounting risks unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations  substantially all of our third party revenue from the united states is invoiced in u s  dollars  though from time to time we may invoice revenue transactions in foreign currencies including intercompany sales  as a result  we may be subject to foreign currency fluctuations on our revenue  the reporting currency for our financial statements is the u s  dollar  however  the assets  liabilities  revenue and costs of our russian  canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries and our brazilian  colombian  and kazakhstan branch offices are denominated in currencies other than u s  dollars  to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we must translate those assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses into u s  dollars at then applicable exchange rates  consequently  increases and decreases in the value of the u s  dollar versus these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements  even if their value has not changed in their original currency  these translations could result in significant changes to our results of operations from period to period  for the fiscal year ended september           approximately    of our consolidated revenue was related to the operations of our foreign subsidiaries and branches  our long lived assets may be subject to impairment  we periodically assess our long lived assets for impairment  significant sustained future decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices may require us to write down the value of our long lived assets in our oil and gas markets business segment  including our manufacturing facilities  manufacturing equipment and rental equipment if future cash flows anticipated to be generated from these assets fall below the asset s net book value  furthermore  we may be required to write down the value of other intangible assets related to our acquisitions of quantum  the optoseis  fiber optic sensing technology or the goodwill and other intangible assets related to our aquana acquisition if sufficient cash flows are not generated to recover the carrying value of such assets  if we are forced to write down the value of our long lived assets  these noncash asset impairments could adversely affect our results of operations  should we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and prevent material fraud  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock  effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent and detect material fraud  if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud  our operating results could be misstated  there can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent control deficiencies from occurring which could cause us to incur unforeseen costs  negatively impact our results of operations  cause the market price of our common stock to decline  or have other potential adverse consequences      this property is located at      pinemont drive in houston  texas  the  pinemont facility    the pinemont facility contains

products and services and our future plans and results  these statements are based on assumptions that we consider to be reasonable  but that could prove to be incorrect  for more information regarding our assumptions  you should refer to the section entitled  cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and assumptions  below  cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and assumptions this annual report on form    k and the documents incorporated by reference herein  if any  contain  forward looking  statements within the meaning of section   a of the securities act

about future events and trends based on the information currently available to us  however  there will likely be events in the future that we are not able to predict or control  the factors listed under the caption  risk factors   as well as cautionary language in this annual report on form    k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements  such examples include  but are not limited to  the failure of the quantum or optoseis  or aquana technology transactions to yield positive operating results  decreases in commodity price levels and continued adverse impact of covid    which could reduce demand for our products  the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance  despite substantial investment by us  our sensitivity to short term backlog  delayed or cancelled customer orders  product obsolescence resulting from poor industry conditions or new technologies  bad debt write offs associated with customer accounts  inability to collect on promissory notes  lack of further orders for our obx rental equipment  failure of our quantum products to be adopted by the border and perimeter security market  or a decrease in such market due to governmental changes  and infringement or failure to protect intellectual property  the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form    k could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position  and actual events and results of operations may vary materially from our current expectations  we assume no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statement  whether written or oral  that we may make from time to time  whether as a result of new information  future developments or otherwise  background we design and manufacture seismic instruments and equipment and primarily market these products to the oil and gas industry to locate  characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs  we also market our seismic products to other industries for vibration monitoring  border and perimeter security and various geotechnical applications  we design and manufacture other products of a non seismic nature  including water meter products  imaging equipment and provide contract manufacturing services  for further information on the nature of our operations  see the information under the heading  business  in this annual report on form    k  consolidated results of operations as we have reported in the past  our revenue and operating profits have varied significantly from quarter to quarter  and even year to year  and are expected to continue that trend in the future  especially when our quarterly or annual financial results are impacted by the presence or absence of relatively large  but somewhat erratic  sales of our oil and gas prm systems and or wireless seismic data acquisition systems for land and marine applications  we report and evaluate financial information for three segments  oil and gas markets  adjacent markets and emerging markets  summary financial data by business segment follows  in thousands   overview although in an already depressed oil and gas industry  demand further decreased in february      because of the oversupply of crude oil due to failed opec negotiations that led to a dramatic drop in crude oil prices when combined with the impact of the covid    pandemic  these declines in the demand for oil and gas have caused oil and gas exploration and production companies to experience a significant reduction in cash flows  which have resulted in reductions in their capital spending budgets for oil and gas exploration focused activities  including seismic data acquisition activities  crude oil prices held above     per barrel throughout      and through september       however  a lag in time typically occurs between higher oil prices and greater demand for our oil and gas markets segment products  we believe this lag is the result of exploration and production   e p   companies allocating their cash flow towards shareholder reward initiatives  such as stock buy back programs and dividend payments  or in debt reduction  we believe this lag is a short term trend that will continue until e p companies decide to reinvest capital into exploration activities  as this lag persists  we expect the reduced levels of demand for our oil and gas markets segment products  we also expect our land based traditional and wireless products will continue to experience low levels of product demand until our customers consume their excess levels of underutilized equipment  during the third quarter of fiscal year       we began to experience an increase in rental demand for our marine nodal products in the form of additional rental contracts and requests for quotes from existing and new customers  the increase in demand has led to near full utilization of our marine wireless rental fleet  yet we continue to experience low levels of demand for our land based wireless products  during the first quarter of fiscal year       we implemented a plan to discontinue the manufacture of certain low margin  low revenue products and reconfigure our production facilities to lower our costs and raise efficiencies  as part of the plan  reductions were made to our workforce which are expected to yield an annual savings of more than    million  in connection with the plan  we incurred costs of      million in the first quarter of fiscal year       primarily termination costs related to the workforce reduction  the costs were recorded both to cost of revenue and operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations  no significant future costs are expected  in light of current market conditions  the inventory balances in our oil and gas markets business segment at september          continued to exceed levels we consider appropriate for the current level of product demand  we are continuing to work aggressively to reduce these legacy inventory balances  however  we are also adding new inventories for new wireless product developments and for other product demand in our adjacent markets segment  during periods of excessive inventory levels  our policy has been  and will continue to be  to record obsolescence expense as we experience reduced product demand and as our inventories continue to age  although the oil and gas markets segment is seeing a recovery after experiencing difficult market conditions  we have been recording additional expenses for inventory obsolescence and will continue to do so in the future until product demand and or resulting inventory turnover return to acceptable levels  armed conflict between russia and ukraine a portion of our oil and gas product manufacturing is conducted through gte  which is based in the russian federation  consequently  our oil and gas business could be directly affected by the current war between russia and ukraine  please see  part i item  a  risk factors  for more information  coronavirus  covid     the ongoing covid    pandemic has negatively impacted worldwide economic activity and continues to create challenges in our markets  the covid    pandemic and the related mitigation measures have disrupted our supply chain  resulting in longer lead times in materials available from suppliers and extended shipping time for these materials to reach our facilities  the occurrence or resurgence of global or regional health events such as the covid    pandemic  and the related government responses  could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity  as such  we will continue to closely monitor covid    and will continue to reassess our strategy and operational structure on a regular  ongoing basis  fiscal year      compared to fiscal year      consolidated revenue for fiscal year      was        million  an increase of       million  or        from fiscal year       the increase in revenue was largely due to higher rental revenue from our oil and gas markets segment due to increased utilization of our obx rental fleet and an increase in demand for our industrial products from our adjacent markets segment  the increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of wireless exploration products  wireless exploration product revenue for fiscal year      also included      million from a rental customer as compensation for lost obx nodes  consolidated gross profit for fiscal year      was       million  an increase of       million  or         from fiscal year       the increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher gross profits from the increased utilization of our obx rental fleet and the increase in industrial product revenue and related gross profits  the increase was partially offset by the decrease in wireless exploration product revenue and related gross profits  consolidated operating expenses for fiscal year      were       million  an increase of      million  or       from fiscal year       the increase was primarily due to a  i       million favorable non cash adjustment reported in the prior year period resulting from a change in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to our quantum and optoseis  acquisitions and  ii  an increase in incentive compensation attributable to the increase in revenue  the increase in operating expenses were partially offset by a  i       million non cash goodwill impairment charge reported in the prior fiscal year related to our quantum acquisition   ii  reduction in personnel costs attributable to our workforce reduction   iii  lower research and development project expenditures and  iv  decrease in bad debt expense resulting from collections of previously reserved past due receivables  in february       we sold our real property located at      langfield road in houston  texas for a cash sales price of      million  net of closing costs of      million  we recognized a gain of      million from the sale of this property in the second quarter of fiscal year       the sale was part of our plan to streamline operations and reduce costs  consolidated other income for fiscal year      was      million compared to      million from fiscal year       the increase in other income was primarily due to a increase in net foreign currency transaction gains  the increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest income attributable to lower note receivable balances between periods  segment results of operations fiscal year      compared to fiscal year      oil and gas markets revenue revenue from our oil and gas markets products for fiscal year      increased       million  or        from fiscal year       the components of this increase were as follows    traditional exploration product revenue   revenue from our traditional products increased      million  or       from the prior fiscal year  the increase primarily reflects higher demand for our sensor and marine products    wireless exploration product revenue   revenue from our wireless exploration products increased       million  or        from the prior fiscal year  the increase was primarily due to increased rental revenue attributable to higher utilization of our obx rental fleet  the increase was partially offset by a decrease in wireless product sales  wireless product revenue for fiscal year      also included the      million from a rental equipment customer as compensation for lost obx nodes  operating income  loss  operating income associated with our oil and gas markets products for fiscal year      was       million  compared to an operating loss of        million from the prior fiscal year  the increase in operating income was primarily due to higher wireless rental revenue and related gross profits due to improved utilization of our obx rental fleet  the improvement in operating income was partially offset by a  i  decrease in wireless product revenue and related gross profits and  ii       million favorable non cash adjustment reported in the prior fiscal year related to the estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to our optoseis  acquisition  adjacent markets revenue revenue from our adjacent markets products for fiscal year      increased      million  or        from the prior fiscal year  the components of this increase were as follows    industrial product revenue and services   revenue from our industrial products increased       million  or        from the prior fiscal year  the increase was primarily due to higher demand for our water meter products    imaging product revenue   revenue from our imaging products decreased      million  or        from the prior fiscal year  the decrease was primarily due to lower demand for our imaging equipment  operating income operating income from our adjacent markets products for fiscal year      was       million  an increase of      million  or       from the prior fiscal year  the increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in revenue and related gross profits  the increase was partially offset by  i  an increase in operating expenses resulting from the increased revenue and  ii  higher research and development expense  operating income for the prior fiscal year included a      million impairment charge on our manufacturing equipment  emerging markets revenue revenue from our emerging markets products for fiscal year      was      million  compared to      million from the prior fiscal year  the increase in revenue was primarily due to revenue of      million recognized on a security related contract completed with a commercial customer  operating loss operating loss from our emerging markets products for fiscal year      was      million  compared to      million from the prior fiscal year  the decrease in operating loss for fiscal year      was primarily due a  i  non cash goodwill impairment charge of      million reported in the prior fiscal year and  ii  lower personnel costs attributable to our workforce reduction  the decrease in operating loss was partially offset by a      million decrease to a favorable non cash adjustment to the estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to our quantum acquisition when compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year  liquidity and capital resources fiscal year      at september           we had approximately       million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  for the fiscal year ended september           we generated       million of cash from operating activities  sources of cash included our net income of       million and net non cash charges of       million resulting from deferred income taxes  depreciation  amortization  accretion  inventory obsolescence  stock based compensation and bad debt recovery  other sources of cash included a  i       million increase in other liabilities due to an increase in customer deposits on rental contracts and accrued employee compensation costs and  ii       million decrease in other assets  these sources of cash were partially offset by  i  a      million increase in trade accounts and notes receivable primarily due to our increase in revenue and the timing of collections from customers   ii  a       million increase in inventories to meet an increase in demand for our products   iii  the removal of      million gross profit from the sale of used rental equipment and  iv  a      million of gain from the sale of property and equipment since they are included in investing activities  for the fiscal year ended september           we used cash of       million in investing activities  uses of cash included  i       million for additions to our property  plant and equipment   ii       million for additions to our equipment rental fleet and  iii  net disbursements of       million for purchases of short term investments  these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds of  i        million from the sale of used rental equipment and  ii       million from the sale of property and equipment  we expect fiscal year      cash investments into our rental fleet will be approximately    million  we expect fiscal year      cash investments in our property  plant and equipment will be approximately    million  our capital expenditures are expected to be funded from our cash on hand  internal cash flows  cash flows from our rental contracts or  if necessary  borrowings under our new credit agreement  for the fiscal year ended september           we used cash of      million from financing activities consisting of  i       million for debt issuance costs related to our new credit agreement and  ii       million for final contingent consideration payments to the former shareholders of quantum  our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was       million at september           which included      million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices  of which      million was held by our subsidiary in the russian federation  in response to sanctions imposed by the u s  and other countries on the russian federation  the russian government has imposed restrictions on companies  abilities to repatriate or otherwise remit cash from their russian based operations to locations outside of russia  as a result  this cash can be used in our russian operations  but we may be unable to transfer it out of russia without incurring substantial costs  if at all  in addition  if we were to repatriate the cash held by our russian subsidiary  we would be required to accrue and pay taxes on any amount repatriated  during fiscal year       in light of recent volatility in the financial markets  we entered into an intrafi cash service   ics   deposit placement agreement with intrafi network llc through our primary bank  woodforest national bank  the ics program offers us access to unlimited federal deposit insurance corporation   fdic   insurance on domestically held cash in excess of      million  thereby mitigating our risk of falling outside of fdic coverage limits  in july       we entered into a credit agreement   the agreement   with woodforest national bank  as sole lender  the agreement refinanced our credit agreement dated may          with amerisource funding  inc   as administrative agent and as a lender  and woodforest national bank  as a lender  the agreement provides a revolving credit facility with a maximum availability of     million  availability under the agreement is determined based upon a borrowing base comprised of certain of our domestic assets which include  i      of eligible accounts receivable  plus  ii      of eligible foreign insured accounts  plus  iii      of eligible inventory plus  iv      of the orderly liquidation value of eligible equipment  in each case subject to certain limitations and adjustments  interest shall accrue on outstanding borrowings at a rate equal to term sofr  secured overnight financing rate  plus a margin equal to       per annum  we are required to make monthly interest payments on borrowed funds  the agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets  except for certain excluded property  the agreement requires us to maintain a minimum  i  consolidated tangible net worth of      million   ii  liquidity of    million  and  iii  current ratio no less than      to       in each case tested quarterly  the agreement also requires us to maintain a springing minimum interest coverage ratio of      to       tested quarterly whenever there is an outstanding balance  the agreement expires in july       at september           we had no outstanding borrowings under the agreement and our borrowing base availability under the agreement was       million after consideration of a      million outstanding letter of credit  we were in compliance with all covenants under the agreement  we do not currently anticipate the need to borrow under the agreement  however  we may decide to do so in the future  if needed  our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased       million during fiscal year       in the absence of future profitable results of operations  we may need to rely on other sources of liquidity to fund our future operations  including executed rental contracts  available borrowings under the agreement through its expiration in july       leveraging or sales of real estate assets  sales of rental assets and other liquidity sources which may be available to us  we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to finance any future operating losses and planned capital expenditures through the next twelve months  we do not have any obligations which meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement and which have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial statements or the items contained therein that are material to investors  contractual obligations contingent compensation costs in connection with the acquisition of aquana in july       we are subject to additional contingent cash payments to the former members of aquana over a six year earn out period  the contingent payments  if any  will be derived from certain eligible revenue generated during the earn out period from products and services sold by aquana  there is no maximum limit to the contingent cash payments that could be made  the merger agreement with aquana requires the continued employment of a certain key employee and former member of aquana for the first four years of the six year earn out period in order for any of aquana s former members to be eligible to receive any earn out payments  in accordance with asc      business combinations  due to the continued employment requirement  no liability has been recorded for the estimated fair value of contingent earn out payments for this transaction  earn outs achieved  if any  will be recorded as compensation expense when incurred  see note    to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form    k for more information on our contractual contingencies  critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes  we consider many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements  we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debt reserves  inventory obsolescence reserves  goodwill and long lived asset impairment  we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors  including the impact from the current economic conditions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions  our normal credit terms for trade receivables are    days  in certain situations  credit terms for trade receivables may be extended to    days or longer and such receivables generally do not require collateral  additionally  we provide long term financing in the form of promissory notes and sales type leases when competitive conditions require such financing and  in such cases  we may require collateral  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our accounts and financing receivables  and allowances are recognized for potential credit losses  our long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable  the impairment review  if necessary  includes a comparison of expected future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying value of the related assets  if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value  we conduct our evaluation of goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of september    and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the guidance on the testing of goodwill for impairment provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  if  based on the qualitative assessment of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount  then it is not necessary to perform a quantitative assessment  however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then a quantitative assessment must be performed  if  based on the quantitative assessment  we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less that its carrying amount  a goodwill impairment is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill  we record a write down of our inventories when the cost basis of any manufactured product  including any estimated future costs to complete the manufacturing process  exceeds its net realizable value  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  cost is determined on a first in  first out method  except that our subsidiaries in the russian federation and the united kingdom use an average cost method to value their inventories  we periodically review the composition of our inventories to determine if market demand  product modifications  technology changes  excessive quantities on hand and other factors hinder our ability to recover our investment in such inventories  management s assessment is based upon historical product demand  estimated future product demand and various other judgments and estimates  inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded when such assessments reveal that portions or components of our inventory investment will not be realized in our operating activities  the value of our inventories not expected to be realized in cash  sold or consumed during our next operating cycle are classified as non current assets in our consolidated balance sheets  we recognize revenue from product sales and services in accordance with asc topic      revenue from contracts with customers  this standard applies to contracts for the sale of products and services and does not apply to contracts for the rental or lease of products  under this standard  we recognize revenue when performance of contractual obligations are satisfied  generally when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers  in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services  revenue from product sales is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied  control is transferred and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured  transfer of control generally occurs with shipment or delivery  depending on the terms of the underlying contract  our products are generally sold without any customer acceptance provisions  and our standard terms of sale do not allow customers to return products for credit  most of our products do not require installation assistance or sophisticated instruction  we offer a standard product warranty  which obligates us to repair or replace our products having manufacturing defects  we maintain a reserve for future warranty costs based on historical experience or  in the absence of historical experience  management estimates  revenue from engineering services is recognized as services are rendered over the duration of a project or as billed on a per hour basis  field service revenue is recognized when services are rendered and is generally priced on a per day rate  we recognize rental revenue as earned over the rental period  rentals of our equipment generally range from daily rentals to rental periods of up to six months or longer  we recognize rental revenue in accordance with asc topic      leases  in the event collectability of lease payments is not probable at the lease commencement date  we recognize revenue when payments are received  we regularly evaluate the collectability of our lease receivables on a lease by lease basis  the evaluation primarily consists of reviewing past due account balances and other factors such as the credit quality of the customer  historical trends of the customer and current economic conditions  we suspend the recognition of rental revenue when the collectability of amounts due are no longer probable and record a direct write off of the lease receivable to rental revenue  recent accounting pronouncements please refer to note   to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements  management s current outlook and assumptions as further discussed above  there remains uncertainties regarding the duration and to what extent the covid    pandemic will ultimately impact the demand for our products and services or with our supply chain  regarding our oil and gas markets business segment  demand for our products are subject to volatile fluctuations in crude oil prices  as a result of substantial declines in crude oil prices in recent years combined with the recent reduced global demand for oil and gas as a result of the covid    pandemic  oil and gas exploration and production companies experienced a significant reduction in cash flows resulting in sharp reductions in their capital spending budgets for oil and gas exploration focused activities including seismic data acquisition activities  while we have experienced stronger marine nodal rental activity in fiscal year       the need for new seismic equipment  particularly land based equipment  remains restrained due to our customers   i  limited capital resources   ii  lack of visibility into future demand for their seismic services and  iii  in some cases  under utilized legacy equipment  crude oil prices have rebounded  however  lasting higher levels of oil and gas commodity pricing may not stabilize in the long term  thus continuing the challenging industry conditions we have experienced in previous fiscal years  many of our land based traditional seismic products can be damaged  destroyed or otherwise consumed during our customer s field operations  we expect fiscal year      demand for our land based traditional seismic products may increase slightly over fiscal year      levels  the vast majority of our oil and gas rental revenue in fiscal year      was derived from short term rentals of our obx ocean bottom recorder  we believe our obx rental revenue will increase in fiscal year      as a result of rental contracts executed during fiscal year      and anticipated new rental contracts  but we can make no assurance in this regard  we expect that fiscal year      revenue from our oil and gas reservoir products  and principally our borehole tools and services  will increase slightly over fiscal year      levels  we have not received any orders for a large scale seabed prm system since november       although we do believe opportunities for prm orders do exist in today s market  if a large scale prm order were received in fiscal year       revenue would likely not be recognized until fiscal year      and       we expect fiscal year      revenue from our adjacent markets products to increase over fiscal year      levels due to our acquisition of aquana and intergration of aquana s products into our business and optimism that demand for our industrial  imaging products and contract manufacturing services will continue to increase in fiscal year       we expect fiscal year      revenue from our emerging markets products to increase over      levels largely due to optimism of obtaining new security related contracts and opportunities with oil and gas industry customers '"
